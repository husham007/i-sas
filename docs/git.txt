################################################################################

1-  For downloading repo from GitHub:
    a-  git clone https://github.com/husham007/i-sas.git
2-  Checking status of repo:
    a- git status

Important!!!!
Always work on your own branch. Do not work on master or development branch.
Always create your branch from development branch. development branch will have all the done code. 
Before creating branch from development branch, first pull from remote development branch to get the latest development branch if required. 

3- Switch to development branch:
    a-  git checkout development
4-  Creating a branch from develoment branch:
    a-  git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
5-  Check status and then start coding.

Basic commands:

1- To add everything after editing your code:
    a- git add .
2- To make a snapshot of your code:
    a-  git commit -m "Your Commit Message"
3-  To push your branch to GitHub:
    a- git push origin your-branch-name


Important again!!!!
If you are done with your feature/task then create a pull request on gitHub.
SomeOne else will review your code and will merge your branch with the development branch.
After successful merge, You need to update your local development branch. 
Switch to development branch and use "git pull origin development" command to get the latest development branch. Then save the changes by using "git add ." Then git commit -m "Your commit message" Then git push origin development"

For another task/feature create new branch for that. Do not work on the branch which is already merged.

If you have any questions, improvements, feel free to ask and suggest :)
Lets do it Team.
